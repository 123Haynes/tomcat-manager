tomcat-manager
--------------

If you use Apache Tomcat for any sort of development work youâ€™ve probably
deployed lots of applications to it. There are a bunch of ways to get your war
files there, you can use the manager application in your browser, or you can
use [Cargo](http://cargo.codehaus.org) and its plugins for ant and maven.
Here's a python script that can do it from the command line by talking to the
web based manager application included with Tomcat.


Download and Install
--------------------

For Python 2.x, please use the python2.x branch.  For Python 3.x and newer, just
use HEAD.

On OS X, *nix, or *BSD, put the script in `~/bin` and rename it to
`tomcat-manager`.

If you use Windows, rename it to `tomcat-manager.py` and put it in your path
somewhere. See http://docs.python.org/3.3/using/windows.html for more details.


Tomcat Configuration
--------------------

Prior to version 6.0.30, you need a user in `tomcat-users.xml` with access to
the `manager` role. So you might have something like this:

	<tomcat-users>
	.....
		<role rolename="manager"/>
		<user username="admin" password="newenglandclamchowder" roles="manager"/>
	</tomcat-users>

From 6.0.30 onwards, the roles required to use the web based manager
application were changed from the single `manager` role to the following four
roles:

- manager-gui
- manager-script
- manager-jmx
- manager-status

Therefore, in order to use the `tomcat-manager` script, you need a user in
`tomcat-users.xml` with access to the `manager-script` role:

	<tomcat-users>
	.....
		<role rolename="manager-script"/>
		<user username="admin" password="newenglandclamchowder" roles="manager-script"/>
	</tomcat-users>



Usage
-----

When you use the web based manager application included with the tomcat
distribution, you typically access it via the url
http://localhost:8080/manager/html. Script access to the same application is
from http://localhost:8080/manager.

This script can either be used in command line mode or interactive mode. To
use interactive mode you can do:

    $ tomcat-manager
	tomcat-manager> connect http://localhost:8080/manager admin newenglandclamchowder
	tomcat-manager> list
	Path                           Status  Sessions
	------------------------------ ------- --------
	/manager                       running 114     
	/                              running 0       
	/host-manager                  running 0
	tomcat-manager> exit

Command line mode might look like:

	$ tomcat-manager --user=admin --password=newenglandclamchowder http://localhost:8080/manager list
	Path                           Status  Sessions
	------------------------------ ------- --------
	/manager                       running 117     
	/                              running 0       
	/host-manager                  running 0

To see all of the valid commands, use interactive mode, like this:

	$ tomcat-manager
	tomcat-manager> help

	Documented commands (type help {command}):
	========================================
	EOF      deploy  help  quit    serverinfo  start  undeploy
	connect  exit    list  reload  sessions    stop 

	Miscellaneous help topics:
	==========================
	license  commandline

For help on a particular command:

	$ tomcat-manager
	tomcat-manager> help connect
	usage: connect url [username] [password]
	tomcat-manager>


Features
--------
This script can perform all of the same functions that can be done with the web based tomcat-admin application included with tomcat.  The following functions are available:

*   *serverinfo* - give some information about the tomcat server, including JVM version, OS Architecture and version, and Tomcat version

*   *sessions* - display active sessions for a particular tomcat application, with a breakdown of session inactivity by time

*   *list* - show all applications running inside the tomcat server

*   *deploy* - install a local war file in the tomcat server

*   *undeploy* - stop execution of and remove a tomcat application from the tomcat server

*   *start* - start a tomcat application that has already been deployed in the tomcat server

*   *stop* - stop execution of a tomcat application but leave it deployed in the tomcat server

*   *reload* - stop and start a tomcat application

There are a few commands that don't do anything to Tomcat, but are necessary for utilization of the script:

*   *connect* - link to an instance of the tomcat manager by url, user and password

*   *help* - get help about a particular command, including usage and parameters

*   *exit* - if you are in interactive mode, exit back to the command line
